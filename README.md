# 🚜 Tractor Sales Prediction – Time Series Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting monthly tractor sales** using historical sales data.  
By analyzing past sales patterns, the project identifies **trends, seasonality, and residual variations** in order to forecast future demand.  

Accurate sales prediction is valuable for **production planning, inventory management, and strategic decision-making** in the agricultural machinery sector.

**##📊 Workflow**

Load and explore the dataset

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize sales trends

Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, residuals

Apply forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA / Holt-Winters)

Generate predictions for upcoming months

Evaluate model accuracy
